    <h2 class= "method">Method</h2>
        <p class= "method1">1. Questionnaire Design<br><br>To facilitate website development, we will first conduct a questionnaire survey regarding language use online versus face-to-face communication. The questionnaire contains a total of 20 questions (mainly MC) covering topics such as differences in tone, wording and sentence structure, prevalence of unique vocabulary or expression in online settings etc. Once the questionnaire was developed, the questions were submitted for the LLM responses. The questions were structured in such ways to allow evaluative and descriptive responses, thus assisting in clarifying how the different LLMs approached each model. To control model effects and ensure valid comparisons between the outputs of different models, all problem statements must be consistent.<br><br><br>2. Data Collection and Analysis<br><br>Responses were collected from eleven different LLMs, including several versions of Qwen2.5, Gemma, and Yi-1.5. The same series of questions were entered in each model, and responses were coded based on thematic categories. For instance, formality, technical issues, pragmatic and linguistics features. Quantitative methods were used to establish frequencies and means of each category across all different model responses. Results were then presented in charts and tables which emphasize similarities and differences in responses to allow a more nuanced understanding of how each LLM embodies online communication and face-to-face interaction.</p>
